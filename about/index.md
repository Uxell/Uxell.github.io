## Hi there!
<center><img src="hello.gif"></center>

My name is Sławek and I am really excited to welcome you to my brand new website!

## A little bit about me
I am a Software Engineer, currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Poznan University Of Technology. As you probably already figured out I also live in Poznan at the moment, but I also can be occasionally found in Szczecin or Wroclaw.  

Currently, the thing I am the most interested in is Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision. In my free time, I try to figure out various Deep Neural Network architectures and how to use them in the most beneficial way to society.  

If you want to know what I have been doing until now, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slawomir-gilewski/) activity.  

## What to expect here
The thing I have been aiming for when creating this website was to have a place where I can share what I have been up to recently. Any interesting or exciting idea or solution to a problem that comes to my mind is going to be presented here.  

The whole website is going to be in English. That being said please let me know if I make some kind of horrendous grammatical mistake.  

## What else?
I hope you will enjoy the things I share and find it inspiring or at least interesting.  

Please bear in mind that I am always open towards constructive criticism, so do not hesitate to contact me if you have any idea how to make something better or if you just want to share your thoughts or have a discussion about something I have written.  

See you on my next post,  
Sławek.
